---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sculpting tools
Clay, flatten, smooth, mask and many other brushes will let you shape your creation.
Need hard lines? You will also find some lasso/line/curve cutting tools.

- Stroke customization
Falloff, alphas, tilings, pencil pressure and other stroke parameters can be customized.
You can save and load your tools preset as well.

- Painting tools
Vertex painting with color, roughness and metalness.
You can easily manage all your material presets as well.

- Layers
Record your sculpting and painting operations in separate layers for easier iteration during the creation process.
Both the sculpting and painting changes are recorded.

- Multiresolution sculpting
Go back and forth between multiple resolution of your mesh for a flexible workflow.

- Voxel remeshing
Remesh quickly your mesh to get a uniform level of detail.
It can be used to quickly sketch a rough shape at the beginning of the creation process.

- Dynamic topology
Refine locally your mesh under your brush to get an automatic level of detail.
You can even keep your layers, as they will be automatically updated!

- Primitive shape
Cylinder, torus, triplanar voxel and other primitives can be used to quickly start new shape from scratch.

- PBR rendering
Beautiful PBR rendering by default, with lighting and shadows.
You can always switch to matcap for a more standard shading for sculpting purposes.

- Post-processing
Screen Space Reflection, Depth of Field, Ambient Occlusion, Tone mapping, etc

- Files
Save and open glTF, OBJ and STL files.
Layers and PBR painting are only kept through GLTF files.

- Interface
Easy-to-use interface, designed for mobile experience.
There is also a lot of customization possible!
